# SimpleTextEditor

In this project, a simple text editor has been implemented using the C curses library.

➡️ The keys 'W' and 'Z' allow the user to navigate through the lines,

➡️ 'I' enables inserting a new line at the current position,

➡️ 'D' deletes the current line, 

➡️ 'S' saves the changes, 

➡️ 'X' exits the program.
